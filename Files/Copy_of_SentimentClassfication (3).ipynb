They are generally good at performing their intended functions without frills: Basic!These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are less than brand name batteries at my local big-box store and appear to work just as well for me. My use in in a keyboard, several remote controls (including Fire TV and Echo remotes), and some radio linked thermometers I bought last century but still work great. I'm sure I use them other places I've forgotten.Do they last as long as Duracell Ultra or whatever super-duper alkaline I might have gotten in the past If they don't, it's not such that I've noticed and that's good enough for me. I'm not into battery performance enough to run tests keep records! If you are, spend more money on famous brand name batteries!What I got was a simple cardboard box with 36 cells group in fours with plastic around each four. A lot like other batteries I've purchased in the last couple of years. No packaging drama and that's nice.The AmazonBasicis AAA batteries perform well enough to satisfy me, are inexpensive, and just fit and work wherever I need AAA cells. Just the basics and that's just what I want. When I get what I want I give 5 stars.Hope this helps someone.\",\"Work Well, Nicely Packaged, Work Fine For Me, Seem To Last Like Duracells In My Use\",ByStephanie Sullivan\n",

            "5,\"With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did.\",AT LAST . . . ONE THAT 'WORKS' 29 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,Amazon Customer\n",
            "4,\"Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba seems to occasionally do. So that is my only con for this item. I would still suggest buying it.\",Cool running 10 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,Amazon Customer\n",

            "4,\"PROS:Well made/good constructionCompares very favorably to famous brand-name packsNo obvious brandingGreat attention to detailLarge main compartmentLots of subcompartmentsOrganizer for pens/sundries in the front compartmentCONS:Generic looksTop handle is minimally padded/perfunctoryStiff nylon in some interior parts makes an audible 'crinkly' sound when movedThe AmazonBasics Laptop Backpack is a well-made, fully featured backpack that can accommodate laptops up to 17 inches wide. This is a simply designed but good looking backpack that could meet most students' needs.The bag is basically a simple, but stylish enough design, with grey highlights and some orange piping on the front. There are enough characteristics to make the bag distinctive but there is no obvious branding on the front. If you look closely, you can find the Amazon basics logo embossed on the black zippers. But you'd have to look really closely. The shoulder straps are backed with a mesh-like material that reduces slippage and are sufficiently wide and padded so that they are comfortable.The main compartment is generous in size, open and closed with two zippers, and is basically broken up into two areas. The back area is generously padded on both sides and is meant to house the laptop. The padding is as good as or even more generous than what I have seen in standard backpacks made by companies like JanSport or L.L. Bean. There is a single large sleeve in front of the padding that is large enough to hold a standard, letter-sized manilla folder filled with papers. The front compartment is basically wide open and has room for traditional textbooks (assuming people still use these) or any other paraphernalia.There are two compartments in the front. There is mid-sized compartment that is in front of the main compartment and a smaller front compartment with the obligatory organizer/pockets to hold pens, a cellphone etc. There is even an internal clip in the front compartment for keys.Additionally, there are small mesh pockets on the sides of the pack and a quick-access, zippered pocket on the very top of the pack. There's even a small mesh pocket on the bottom of the left shoulder strap.Although I doubt that this is ballistic nylon, it appears to be very well made. The edges line up very well and there is no dog-earing in the fabric. The top handle is only minimally padded and a bit flimsy for a pack this size. Clearly, you could lift the pack via the handle to move it from the floor to your desk, but the handle isn't comfortable or sturdy enough to carry the pack like a suitcase. The nylon that makes up the dividers is stiff and makes an audible crinkly sound when manipulated. This likely will go away over time, but if you are late to class and walking into a quiet lecture hall this could be a distraction.The zippers move easily. They are large enough to grip and they all have nylon tags sewn to the end to make them easier to pull. The zippers seem strong enough for a pack of this size and caliber.All-in-all this is a very well made back pack at an excellent price point. It may not win major style points for some students, but it is a great basic backpack.\",Great basic backpack that compares favorably with better known brand name packs,Jojoleb jojoleb\n",
            "4,\"I ordered this backpack in anticipation of a 10-day vacation to Universal Studios and a Royal Caribbean cruise. I needed something to carry my laptop where I could easily remove it for security, and that had lots of pockets for my travel papers and various things I needed to keep my 6yo busy.This AmazonBasics laptop is well-made and sturdy with a variety of pocket sizes and places to put stuff. Whatever material they used for the inside of the bag makes it very loud and crinkly, but also easy to clean. There is at least one pocket that seems extraneous and almost gets in the way, and when all the pockets are closed, there is an over abundance of zipper pulls. But the bag traveled very well and I like the sleeker style of it.The backpack is a bit much for everyday use (just in bulk and number of pockets, etc), but I'm happy to have it for future travels.\",Great for traveling.,Stacey The Scenic Life\n",
            "5,I was expecting the backpack to be a little flimsy consider the price but it's great. The padding for my back and the laptop pocket is nice and thick. There is even a secondary pocket on the front of the laptop pouch that can fit my 8 tablet. Overall I really like it because it has so many pockets and little compartments. The only bad thing I can see about it is how they made it so cheap is that the material inside for like the pockets and stuff is really flimsy so it'll be easily punctured by pens and pencils and stuff. For me though that's no big deal because the outside of it is sturdy and will keep my stuff safe.,Great stuff,K. Harris Kitty lover .\n",

Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone.\",Main pocket does not open wide as I would like,B.

            "3,\"There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basics laptop and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive.

            "5,\"Even though this is classified as a laptop backpack, I'm really finding it much more useful as an all-purpose backpack. Of course, you could carry your laptop in it - there's a compartment specifically designed for one (17 or less) - but it's also comfortable and useful for general use.The backing is very sturdy. This sturdiness is designed to protect a laptop from tumbles and falls, but I love it for other reasons: First, I can throw all sorts of junk in this backpack (big books, a lunchbox, shoes, etc.) and nothing bulges from the back. This happens often with other backpacks, causing them to be difficult to carry, but the sturdy backing prevents this here. Second, it is quite comfortable. It's not a hard plastic backing, but just seems to be rigidly padded, and it almost feels like it's helping my posture when I wear it.My only complaint, and it isn't a big one, is that there are almost too many pockets and organizational compartments. It can get a bit complicated remembering where something is, especially if you have a lot of stuff. This may just take a bit more getting used to, however, and it doesn't diminish the fact that this is a really great backpack. In fact I'd add that all this extra room inside the backpack is a bonus. Yes, I am really quite liking this backpack.\",One of the best backpacks I've ever owned,A. Burke\n",

            "5,\"I'm a lifelong backpack user, starting back after WW2 when my father outfitted us all with Army surplus items. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to hike we go. Or snowshoe. Oh, it was a different world then, and I'm not saying better. The equipment was heavy and prone to mildew if you weren't careful, as it was all made of natural fiber with metal fittings. And they hadn't yet heard of ergonomicsHere we have yet another AmazonBasics product that is a winner. An improved, contemporary version of that old military surplus that first accompanied us into the woods - I've followed a lifetime of upgrades. This is a nice big bag with lots of pockets and zippers. Like most of today's technical products, it is a tradeoff between total protection and portability. So no, you wouldn't throw this with your laptop inside and expect complete protection. But it is made of high quality nylon and other tekkie fabrics, has adequate padding and well shaped, comfortable pack straps, a handle on top where it belongs, and more straps, buckles and pockets here and there. I love straps, buckles and pockets.It can be expected to be water resistant, although for extended use in rain you would need a separate rain cover made of coated waterproof nylon. This backpack has a very pleasing look, mostly black with orange accents and is a nice conservative shape. And it is a very good value, which you will discover if you go shopping at the well-known places for this kind of thing.\",Winner,nonpareil\n",

            "5,\"Recently, I spent my hard earned money on a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012. I like to take care of my personal belongings, and this 1000 piece of machinery was no exception. So this began my search for a laptop sleeve. Wandering my local general stores (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc.) I noticed a cheap laptop sleeve (as in cheap quality) was nearly 16! I was like HECK NO! So I jumped on Amazon (btw amazon is the best shoutout to all the hard workers running this website and service) and searched a laptop sleeve. After approximately 9.24 seconds of searching I came across this gem. COULD IT BE! An affordable, durable, and classy laptop sleeve for under 10. Being the educated consumer I started to read reviews. I came across a few that said: Laptop Didn't Fit. This was it, this was the end, I built it all up to let myself down. But being the poor High-School student I am, I pocketed some of my parents lunch money and ordered it. When it got here I opened the package. You know the scene in Star Wars when Darth Vader removed his mask That's what it was like, shocking, but beautiful. I unboxed it and immediately took my laptop out of my backpack (which was stored in a nice soft tee-shirt previous to this sleeve purchase) and tried to slip it in the case. Wow. The sleeve fit like a glove.If you have a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012, I highly recommend this product. It protects your laptop very well and snug. No other sleeve is as affordable, fashionable, and durable as this one.\",Perfect. 339 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,Don Juan\n",

            "5,\"I have the Western Digital My Passport Ultra 2TB USB 3.0 Portable Drive 2.5 (laptop size) external hard drive. The hard drives case is mostly plastic with a thin pretty metal sheet top that's more for aesthetics than protection. I originally bought the matching extra-tough pod like WD Nomad Rugged case that offers great protection. Once fitted into the Nomad, the drive stays in the sealed protective case with only the USB3 port accessible behind a rubber flap - and given the light-weight feel of the WD Passports plastic drive case the extra protection of the Nomad was reassuring. However there's a big negative negative in that the case has nowhere to store the short 40cm USB3 cable (plus the Nomad pod hides the drive LEDs). As an alternative I tried this cheap Amazon Basic 2.5 external hard drive case.The AmazonBasics case is less ruggedised, but the My Passport Ultra drive fitted the case perfectly, and very usefully the case has plenty of space for storing the USB3 cable (it fits in behind a netted pocket on the top flap). The hard drive itself is held in by a strap to prevent the drive slipping out when you open the case. Laptop size 2.5 hard drives have extra shock protection over their 3.5 desktop versions, being designed for portable use, so this AmazonBasics case offers more than adequate protection when traveling (I slip my case into the backpack when commuting). I now find I'm using the case in preference to the Nomad version simply as it's far more convenient for keeping tabs on the drive's USB3 cable. This AmazonBasics case works well, seems well made, and it's very cheap at 7, so 5* for function and value.\",A perfect fit for my Western Digital 'My Passport Ultra 2TB USB3' drive and lots of room for the USB cable,KeithJoseph\n",

            "5,\"I travel internationally at least once a year and wanted an EASY way to charge my Kindle Fire HD. The design of this system is great. It's one basic plug and cord with changeable heads. It's easy to use and easy to pack. I tried out the European head recently in Norway and it worded great. Some voltage converter + plug adapter sets don't work well there because the Norwegian outlets are deep. This worked perfectly. I also bought this set because it had a U.S. plug and I can charge quickly here at home. There have been some criticisms that the country name isn't printed on the plug head, but the set comes with an extensive list of which heads are needed for which countries, which I find to be adequate. A great product.\",A great design,Friend o' Fiber\n",
            "5,\"Works on my kindle, Samsung Galaxy Note and my IPod Touch!!! Love this multi-funtional charger! I didn't need the international kit but i wasn't sure...maybe on day it will come in handy.\",LOVE IT,Danielle Everett\n",
            "5,\"I recently went out of the country and took this charging kit with me. Changing the different plugs adapters was extremely easy, and I had no problems with the setup and charging my Kindle. In fact the charger that is included in this kit is a slightly larger wattage than the adapter that came with my Fire HDX, which allowed for faster charging. Since returning home, I have attached the US 110W adapter and am using it as an additional adapter. The one issue that would have made this item better would have been if they had included a carrying bag for the adapters. Yes, I'd love a nice carrying case, but even if that wasn't an option, having a cloth bag with a draw string would have been preferable since some people may need multiple adapters when the travel.\",Must buy for any Kindle owner expecting to travel abroad,Babsbny reads way too much\n",
            "4,\"As abv, takes 3 + hours to fully charge. I hoped it would be much faster (maybe an hour), to the point that I had thought I got a lemon. People were kind enough to answer my question, and learned that I should not expect miracles, lol. Apart from that, good thing it comes with the cord, and is compact enough.\",Take abt 3+ hours to charge completely,M. Tz.\n",
            "5,\"I do a lot of international travelling, so I have bought just about every conversion and adapter kit on the market. This is the best-made and most versatile I have seen to charge electronic devices, including but not limited to the Kindles. It is a powerful 9 watts and will work safely on any device using a micro-B USB charging port. It can also be used with non-standard devices, like Apple products or older electronics having mini-B ports, as long as you have the appropriate USB cord for it. It can be used in almost every country (the standard European C plug can be used in most outliers like the South American countries and Israel because their plugs are dual type).The charger is as small as it could be for such a powerful charger, is very durable, and compact. I like it because the interchangeable plugs actually form part of the charger. I have a bad tendency to leave adapters in the wall socket and just remove my US charger. The next hotel guest gets a free adapter.This is at a new price of 29.99(10 less than before). This makes it a very good value, considering the design and quality. Unlike the standard PowerFast charger for the Kindle Fire, this kit comes with a USB cord, so it is complete. An added bonus is that the adapters can twist on in any direction, so you can position the USB cord on the side, top or bottom.\",Very Nice International Charger,Just Wondering\n",

            "2,\"When I got my Kindle Fire, I got a protective cover for it and figured I'd be ok, because I don't travel much at all (am bedridden/disabled from car accidents). After a while, I couldn't get the mini-USB cord to stay in the plug on the Kindle. After describing the problem to Amazon, they sent me a new cord (I got the newer one with an AC plug and had to pay for it). Unfortunately this did not solve the problem, and I had to mail them my Kindle, and they shipped me a new one, configured mostly the way I had everything before I sent it, which was very convenient. Using my new cable (purchased through the Amazon Kindle store), I had no problems, at first.With only very light use, primarily for reading books for short intervals, the problem I had before with the mini USB plug on the Kindle not fitting tightly into its socket. After changing up AC to USB, as well as trying both USBs on my computer, I was unable to get the Kindle to start because it had less than 15 charge on the battery but I had no way to charge it. The only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above I read a number of the positive reviews (which are usually posted first), and nothing was mentioned about this problem--there were so many reviews I didn't have the time to go through them all. I'm in the middle of a book, and use the Kindle to play Scrabble with a friend, and we're in the middle of a game...So I haven't decided what to do yet... It's after 5 a.m. Sunday morning so I can't call the Kindle Store for advice.I had been considering upgrading to one of the new Kindle products, but after having this recurring problem, I am leery of spending that kind of money, only to possibly have the same issue.Read more\",Problems with both Kindle mini-USB cord and mini-USB plug on the device,Kindle Customer\n",

            "5,\"I own two echos and 1 amazon firetv. Alexa is on all. Echo is great if.... you DO subscribe to Amazon Prime Membership and get the free music that comes with it. (Prime comes with 250 song limit) I also have added the extra 250,000 songs for 29 and now have uploaded over 13,000 songs of my own. I don't need to listen to the music I can't stand! 50's 60's some 70's and 80's are what I want and instrumentals Mantovani, 101 strings, Paul Mauriat, Herb Alpert, etc sound great on it.Just have to say: Alexa, shuffle Neil Diamond, Alexa, shuffle Petula Clark, Alexa, play Sound of Music, Alexa, what is the temperature. Alexa, score Cubs etc. You get the idea. You can set multiple alarms up to 24 hours in advance, You can ask for Motels and Hotels around Dubuque, IA. How many days till Christmas (or any date you ask for). I fall to sleep every night with Alexa, play Streams and Birds. She will then play a water stream with birds singing. or whatever you want to hear such as rainforest, thunder and rain, frogs along the Mississippi, etc. They ARE part of my life now. I sit outside and listen to whatever type of music I'm in the mood for. It must have a WIFI connection to be used, and some type of pad, Kindle fire, ipad, phones, etc. to set it up to your (or anyones) WIFI. You must download the Alexa App (free on Amazon), to set it up with your home location, and your WIFI. If you unplug it from one outlet in your home and want to take it outside, as long as it can still get WIFI, all you have to do is plug it in and it will find your wifi again. I just can't say enough about how I like it and it WILL be getting a lot better as they are still upgrading them.Read full review...\",echo w/remote great if......,kids_bus_driver\n",

            "4,\"It has a surprisingly quick response to the queries that it does recognize. I found its necessary to be rather specific in the way commands are phrased. Also a good bit of set up is involved, including subscription and agreeing to terms and conditions that nobody ever reads. And even then, it seems copyright laws limit the echo.I would like to be able to promt a command with something I choose as apposed to saying Alexa every time. It seems with something so adaptable, this would be easy to make available. Perhaps it is and I simply haven't found how yet.All around fun device, with good quality sound.

I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.\",\"Awesome, smart little portable speaker\",Tazman3582\n",
            "5,\"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!\",Awesome!,LookoutNoah\n",
            "5,\"If you have an Amazon Echo already then you know what a great gadget it is. This is Echo in baby size and portable. The newer version can be \"\"woken up\"\" with your voice like its big sister or you can program it to only respond when you push the mike button. It had all the features of Echo and excellent sound for its size. I have it in the bedroom and use it as an alarm and music when I get dressed. All in all a great item for the price.\",Baby Echo with good sound for the size,ChrisK\n",

We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its \"\"Hands-Free\"\" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...\",Better sound than expected!,Willie4\n",

            "3,\"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front.

            "5,\"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few \"\"I didn't understand that\"\" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.\",\"Full Size, yet portable\",Stevarino\n",

            "5,\"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.\",Fun and easy.,Dani\n",
            "5,\"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller \"\"just\"\" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!\",Fun and Useful with Great Sound,Happytekki\n",

            "4,\"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!\",Good companion to Echo,Mike\n",
            "4,\"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do.\",Good fit with Echo,nvcop\n",

            "4,\"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!\",\"good, but missing key feature\",metacuate\n",
            "4,\"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.\",\"Good, but not great\",MikeB\n",
            "5,\"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my \"\"go to\"\" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!\",Got me hooked!,ITGuy\n",

            "5,\"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the \"\"tap\"\" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist!

            "4,\"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word \"\"Alexis\"\", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.\",Great device,JeffM\n",

            "4,\"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use \"\"Always On\"\" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using \"\"Always On\"\" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere\",Great Device Made better with Sofware Update,RVCOS\n",
            "5,\"Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase.\",Great device overall,Calin44\n",

            "4,\"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music.\",Great for a purpose,PABuyer\n",

            "5,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,Great for portability.,lntr4550\n",
            "5,Didn't want to spend $200 on the Echo for someone who's not use to using a Bluetooth speaker. Great buy and functions well.,Great for those new to Bluetooth,Risha37\n",
            "5,\"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo.\",Great for what it does,Casey\n",
            "5,\"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me\",Great fun,Bsmm\n",
            "5,\"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!\",Great fun for the family,Gdub61\n",
            "5,\"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing.\",Great fun. I love it!,Herb\n",
            "5,\"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.\",Great functionality and portable,Scearls\n",
            "4,\"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL.\",Great functions. Speaker could be better.,unplug\n",
            "4,It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.,Great gadget,Muzz2160\n",

            "4,\"I( read the reviews and even listened to this in store. But much to my chagrin, at high volume, this will not cut it. The portability is great!\",Great if sound quality is no big deal,Zack\n",
            "4,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,Great Item,Fishnan10\n",

            "4,\"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers.\",Great little Alexa Speaker,dealhunter\n",
            "5,\"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.\",Great little speaker,Fredd\n",
            "4,Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!,Great little speaker,bkgrigsby725\n",
            "4,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.,Great model to have in garage/outdoors.,Sam318\n",
            "5,The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.,Great music player!,Zigcredo\n",
            "5,\"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it.\",Great on the go speaker,SuperNintendoChalmers\n",
            "4,\"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account.\",Great overpriced alarm clock!,Fern\n",
            "5,\"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!\",Great piece of tech!,Robbleo\n",
            "5,\"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!\",Great portabe Alexa,SBgamer\n",

            "5,\"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp\",Great portable speaker,techjunkie\n",
            "4,\"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.\",Great portable speaker,Sparkygirl\n",

            "5,\"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear.

            "4,\"I love this product and that you can take \"\"Alexa\"\" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to \"\"tap\"\" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.\",Great speaker.

            "4,\"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else.

            "4,\"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice.

The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.\",Handy speaker if you don't need the best sound.,Vaiolation\n",

            "2,\"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated.

My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.\",My kids know Alexa...,DaddyLife\n",

            "5,\"I have missed my Pandora since I moved from Ft. Worth, TX to Colorado a few months ago. My nephew had the Amazon Tap and I was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it ( saying.. ALEXA.. tell MIMI (their Grandmother) to GO TO BED.. AND IT DID!! And the sound and quality of music coming from it. Awesome. :) I had to have one, so I went to local Best Buy and bought it. I even set it up myself (I'm 65 so was impressed with myself! LOL) but I have listened nonstop to 60s music or music from DIRTY DANCING (which I loved). I have ordered a little case from Amazon.com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room, which I have been doing. I feel like I have a new found friend.... love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as BOSE in my book! Get it, you'll love it! I DO!! :) VERY VERY pleased with it! Weather updates here or where my kdis are. Just checking. :)No interruptions or commercials when listening ALL DAY LONG!\",My new found friend!!,ohionana\n",

            "4,I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!,Nice addition to the echo lineup,FloridaOh9\n",
            "4,\"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.\",Nice alternative to the Echo,LooLoo777\n",
            "5,I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability.

            "4,\"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo \"\"grow\"\" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.\",\"Nice,however.\",BestBuyjukie\n",

            "4,\"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.\",\"Not a bad product, but the button is annoying...\",grock2727\n",
            "1,\"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear\",Not a good product,Albert\n",
            "4,\"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.\",Not a portable Echo,Ottoman\n",
            "3,Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,Not as good as I think..,SCHO\n",
            "3,\"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.\",Not as great as the Echo,hulio5\n",
            "4,\"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.\",Not bad.,Mike\n",
            "2,Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.,Not impressed,Pogera\n",
            "4,\"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to \"\"tap\"\" the speaker to get it to listen.\",\"Not perfect, but does a great job\",TJay\n",
            "2,\"Like DOS, you need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you cant use Spotify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Spotify. If you have paid account for Spotify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Tap, Google Home is just much smarter. The sound of this Tap is very good indeed, but I return it because it cant do music alarm, also it cant use Spotify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Home.\",Not smart to know what I asked,cw9132_3\n",
            "2,\"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.\",Not what I expected,Blue\n",
            "3,You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.,Not what I thought,Justme\n",
            "5,\"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it.\",Now hands-free,Jdnlex\n",
            "5,\"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!\",\"Now I have a Tap, too\",jlivar\n",
            "5,\"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.\",Now I have Alexa at work,JP315\n",
            "3,\"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!\",OK,marie\n",
            "4,We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.,Ok but the echo is better,Mac1\n",
            "3,\"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable.\",Ok for what it is,Gerald\n",
            "3,\"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting\",Ok product,Blaze\n",
            "3,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,ok product,Rick\n",
            "3,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.,Okay sound,AnthonyZ\n",
            "2,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.,Okay!?,BuckS\n",

            "4,\"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone.\",Overall good,Dylon\n",
            "5,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,Perfect companion for Amazon Echo,B6W356\n",
            "5,\"Anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this.

            "5,\"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets \"\"the girl's name\"\" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name.

            "5,\"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.\",Perfect to play music,natm\n",

            "5,\"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say \"\"Alexa\"\" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!\",Portable,Mike\n",
            "4,I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.,Portable & good sound,Stormie\n",
            "5,\"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go.\",Portable Alexa,AC118\n",
            "5,\"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!\",Portable and great sound!,Marken\n",
            "5,\"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo.\",Portable and Hands free,Kokko\n",
            "5,\"Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use.\",Portable and Very Cool,Kokko\n",
            "5,\"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.\",Portable interactive entertainment,Bugbasher\n",
            "4,\"It takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed. Overall , once it's set up it's super easy to use.

            "5,\"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the \"\"button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.\",Privacy + Alexa = Awesome,Rittir\n",

            "2,\"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens.

            "3,\"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C.

            "5,\"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more\",Tap Alexa on the go!,Heather A\n",

            "5,\"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.\",The most versatile of all Amazon Echos,RickR\n",
            "5,\"I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music.\",THE most versitle of the Amazon line up,Boschbeliever\n",
            "5,\"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT\"\"S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!\",The Perfect Bluetooth Speaker...Plus So Much More!,CellPhoneGuy\n",

            "5,\"I love my Amazon Tap. I was in the market for a portable speaker and I saw these one on sale so I decided to pick it up. I only wanted it for a Bluetooth speaker, but Alexa is amazing I use it everyday. Alexa was a huge plus.\",Use it everyday,Montiel168\n",
            "5,\"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a \"\"beat box\"\" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a \"\"beat box\"\" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well.\",Use it everyday,thoroughlymorgan\n",
            "4,\"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa.....

            "4,\"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot.

            "4,\"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem.

Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content.

            "5,\"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard.

The cable is sturdy and is gold plated for better connectivity (I assume that helps. There is no real way to test that at home).The cables are priced similarly to competitors. The nice thing about it being an Amazon product is that I am sure the return policy would be simple and quick. One word of caution is make sure both devices you are connecting are USB 3.0. The A side will fit in a 2.0 socket, but the B side will not. Check your devices documentation. It does no good to use this cable if both devices are not USB 3.0.

            "1,\"One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much.

            "1,\"No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended.\",Why yet another charger,Jeff L Howley\n",

Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time.

            "4,\"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.\",Best Kindle but not Perfect,Jeff\n",

            "5,\"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.\",Best Kindle yet,mjcatt\n",

            "5,\"The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper. The Voyage has a bezel that's flush with it's glass so it's not the \"\"crumb catcher\"\" paperwhite is but hey, maybe you want to skip eating while you're reading and save the dough!\",Best of the Best...but get it on sale if you can!,Kyoung33\n",

I had been using an Ipod with audio books for a long time but I got tired of the difficulty in searching for material. It also lost my place unless I was extremely careful.

            "4,\"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters.\",Dedicated Reader,Strangelove74\n",

            "1,\"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(\",Device failed after two uses,Disappointed\n",

            "4,\"I am a big fan of e-readers. I prefer the e-ink screens over tablet screen when reading books. I decided to pick up the new Kindle Voyage. Here are my thoughts.First, the Kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the Paperwhite model. It's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.Secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make. If you're a casual reader who has a Paperwhite, you're probably okay with what you have.\",Excellent e-reader,Cooper25\n",
            "5,\"I purchased this Kindle because I wanted the buttons on the side -- I prefer to hold my e-reader in just my left hand and it's hard to turn pages by screen press only. I love this so far! It's an upgrade from my Nook because it's so much easier to borrow books from the library! I've never used a Paperwhite so I can't speak as to how it's better, other than it has the side-press buttons (which was worth it to me).\",Excellent e-reader,jessamaybe\n",

            "4,\"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!\",Excellent for avid readers,corimaysss\n",

            "4,\"I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a \"\" two toned\"\" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay.\",Good product. Amazon warentees!,kcladyz\n",

Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up.

            "4,\"Although the Price point is a bit high for what it is I love the new kindle. The screen is beautiful, the back light with auto-adjust dimming is great, and it feels very sturdy to hold. I am very glad that I upgraded form the nook but can only give 4 stars due to price.\",Great e-reader,utpike\n",
            "5,\"I like the small size and auto adjustable lighted screen. With my old Kindle I needed to have external light to read, but this one comes with the build one.\",Great e-reader,Alex\n",
            "5,\"I read often and love this e-reader. I previously had a nook and liked it, but it was old and did not have night reading option. The voyage is light and easy to hold. The backlighting is great at night. Overall very happy with this product for reading.\",Great e-reader,Heed\n",
            "4,If you already have a Paperwhite then there is no need to upgrade. But if you are in the market this has an excellent display and quick page turns. The reason to buy a dedicated e-reader is the 3 week long battery life. Love it,Great e-reader,AdriQ\n",

            "5,\"This is my second Kindle (the first one lasted several years). I enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light. The backlight works very well and does not have the eye strain that a tablet may have. With the touch surface, I find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several pages. The side page turn works very well. Much easier to travel with this unit than a large book.\",Great E-Reader,DRDEH\n",
            "5,\"This is my second Kindle device. I enjoy using this to read in lower light conditions with the automatic adjustment. Touch screen is nice, but can accidentally move pagesif your fingers slip. No issues with readability in many light conditions.\",Great e-reader,Drdeh\n",
            "4,\"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We have been using a Nook for the last 2 years (bought at Best Buy - got 2 and a great deal) Can't use Nook to read in sunlight. The Voyage is smaller, lighter and easier to use. Have not used it yet to read in sunlight. Wish it had some other features like - color display and sound. Waiting to see if I decide to get one until then I still am using a Nook. Very easy to download a book from public library. It is a tad expensive for what it does.\",Great e-reader - Wife loves X-mass present,George\n",

            "5,\"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.\",\"Great e-reader, no complaints\",DebraPants\n",

            "5,\"My last kindle died right before Christmas. I was lost with no way to read my books. Went to Best Buy to look at all the different ones available.

            "4,\"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop. This does not compete with them. Absolutely outstanding outside in Dallas. This does not overheat, with absolutely zero glare. Yes I can read in the pool on a sunny day. I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail. I wish the unit was truly water resistant and it's built in browser is almost worthless. This is an eReader and not a tablet.\",Great eReader,CADCAM\n",

            "4,\"This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!\",Great first e-reader,lilypad23\n",

Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite.

            "5,\"Though not super noticible the resolution is better on the voyage.

            "5,\"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes.

I was apprehensive about upgrading given the higher cost but it was entirely worth it. The Paperwhite is lite in weight but somehow the Voyage feels weightless. The screen is absolutely beautiful and to me the nicest feature is the screen is flush with the bezel around.

The commercials that tell you how much better it is to read on a Kindle Voyage vs a tablet are true. I read for hours at a time on weekly plane trips.

            "4,\"I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now.

            "5,\"I am an avid reader, and have purchased both the first and second generations of the Kindle Paperwhite products. Upon reading about the Voyage, I knew I had to have one. Although it's a bit pricey for an e-reader, it's definitely worth it for me. As much as I read, I believe the new screen will result in less eye strain. It's a beauty to look at. Especially when held next to the Paperwhite 2nd gen and compared.\",Kindle Voyage the best e-reader ever,DannyH\n",

            "4,\"Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to \"\"fade in\"\" animation in PowerPoint. I would prefer more seemless appearance of next page.\",Light and long battery,Daisy\n",
            "4,\"To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2.\",Light gradient issue vs best reader atm,Logos\n",

I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up.

            "5,\"I upgraded from the Kindle Touch so I could have a built in light. The light is fantastic. While it took some getting used to the press buttons for page turning on the side, I love that too. Can use it with one hand, and don't have to take hands off to touch the screen. The documentation could use some work. A diagram with what all those icons are that they refer to would be a big help. Took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what I wanted. One thing, I HATE the new bookmark method. The old 'corner fold' was easier and less intrusive. Still can figure out how to delete from My Clippings. Also I wish Amazon would come out with a case similar to an Otter Box. I don't want leather OR auto turn on, which seems to be problematic on nearly every case I look at.\",Love the light!,JudyT\n",

            "4,\"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is \"\"frozen\"\" on the ad. It says \"\"swipe to open\"\" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know.\",\"Mostly Love It, a few glitches\",Joan\n",

            "5,\"I am extremely pleased with my Kindle Voyage. It lives up to the hype. It is slightly smaller and lighter than the previous version. The ambient light monitor works well. Text is clear and very readable. My only negative comment would be that the battery does not seem to last as long as I expected. I have recently retired; so I am reading more. I recharge the reader about every week and a half. That said, I am reading indoors and perhaps the ambient backlighting is on more than normal.\",Superb E-Reader,Holsum\n",

            "4,\"The Kindle Voyage is the best e-reader experience available. Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right.

            "4,\"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical \"\"buttons\"\" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device.\",The best eReader available,robinhood22\n",
            "5,I was a little bit hesitant to get the Voyage over the Paperwhite and after holding the two I knew I wanted the Voyage. This device has been perfect! (Advice: Ask Amazon to remove the ads if you're a Prime member!),The best Kindle yet!,xJCF\n",
            "5,\"To advance the page or go back to the previous one, just press lightly on a pair of gray lines and dots on either side of the front bezel. Is nice to see the transition.

Lastly, the power button has been moved back here from the bottom edge.\",The best reader so far,epastrana\n",
            "5,I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever.

            "5,\"This is a really great upgrade from the regular Kindle, however, it's not such an appealing product after Amazon updated the base Kindle to the same hi-resolution screen.

            "4,\"This is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite, not sure is worth the premium though. While faster than paperwhite it is still way less responsive than an iPad, it is very hard to type on it (when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance).I like the navigation areas on the edge of the screen but I'm not crazy about them. I'm not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that comfortable while reading in bed. I guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely.I previously had a Paperwhite which got lost and I thought I'd better buy the latest kindle now.When I bought the paperwhite it has been an experiment, as I'm not an avid reader and I have a hard time reading paper book since I got surrounded by gadgets. I actually read few books on the paperwhite and I enjoyed it. So when I lost it (misplaced it) I was longing for it as I had few books I wanted to read.If this would be priced at least $50 cheaper I think it would be a 5 star proposition. Like it is now, it is a tad too expensive for the scope and the shortcomings. Closer to $100 it would be a sweet price.Prefered buying at BestBuy over Amazon as the loyalty programs are better (vs nonexistent) and I also used a movers coupon.\",Very good ereader albeit expensive and still slow,Savvybuyer\n",

            "5,\"I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always bothered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually. But that's a small issue for an otherwise great e-reader.\",Very good update to my first gen Paperwhite,Jeff\n",

            "5,\"I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the \"\"official\"\" cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).\",Wonderful reading,MZ000\n",
            "4,\"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets.

            "5,No regrets with this device. The Paperwhite from Amazon is a cheaper model that's worth looking into if this model is too much.

All those books on such a small and thin device is still amazing to me. This and the official Amazon case is what I use.,Worth Getting,GadgetGuy\n",
            "4,\"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.\",Worth the $... For me.,swhittak\n",
            "5,Upgraded from an old 2nd gen kindle and this is much better,Worth the extra money,greg\n",
            "5,\"I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White.\",Worth the Premium Price,Aaron\n",
            "5,\"This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.\",Wow,Knight\n",

I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment.

            "5,\"Amazon Echo Plus is a fun product it requires time to explore its skills.

            "5,\"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped.\",A good buy!,jaxson\n",

He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool.

The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol.

            "5,\"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\",AWESOME SAUCE,Boomstick\n",

In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.\",Best Kindle for my needs*,DavidB\n",

            "1,\"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.\",Chronic issue with charging port,Melissa0414\n",

            "1,\"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\"\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.\",Couldn't possibly hate it more.,ValC\n",

The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old.

Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the \"\"low price\"\" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase?

Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future.

            "4,\"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.\",Excellent Portable Media Device / Backup Tablet,BB808\n",

            "5,\"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7\"\" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!\",Excellent Product,PaulieC\n",

It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!\",Fantastic so nice bought it 3x,Ishop4u\n",
            "5,\"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.\",Fantastic Tablet for kids,explore42\n",
            "5,This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.,Fantastic tablet for kids,eabemt\n",
            "5,\"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8\"\" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself.\",Fantastic Tablet for the price,rksj0000\n",

I'm buying this for my four-year old and I'm not planning on her being on the tablet for six hours, let alone 8 or 9, which is what bigger tablets can handle.

            "4,\"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old.\",Good Option Among Value Tablets,jrrabbi\n",

            "4,\"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device.

            "4,\"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device.

            "4,\"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.\",Great Alternative to College Textbooks,Phil\n",

            "4,\"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you.

            "4,\"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.\",Great as a tablet and E-reader,JackieW\n",
            "4,I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.,Great as ereader,Me2016\n",
            "5,\"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\"\" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).\",Great Bang for the Buck,Andrew\n",

            "3,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,Great basic tablet,Jill\n",
            "4,\"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad.\",\"Great basic tablet, best with Prime subscription\",Vivekkumar\n",

            "4,\"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.\",Great but aggravating at times,Dani\n",

            "5,\"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.\",Great for a 2 year old,April\n",

The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!\",Great for a Beginner,alshovald\n",

            "4,\"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.\",Great For Basic To Moderate Use,ChucklesTheCheat\n",

            "4,\"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!\",Great for kids!,nicscrappy\n",

It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children.

In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it\",\"Great fun,Educational apps,books,brain teasers\",LT17\n",

            "5,\"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.\",Great kids tablet,Ssaviola85\n",
            "5,\"I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games.\",Great kids tablet,Meg61\n",

I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price\",Great kids tablet,Wifeofrecentespressolover\n",

            "5,\"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job.\",Great little tablet,MRpopo\n",

            "4,\"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"\"back\"\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"\"X\"\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"\"new items.\"\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under \"\"new items\"\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"\"home\"\" menu. It's the \"\"recent\"\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"\"On Deck\"\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"\"on deck\"\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.\",Great price on an awesome little tablet,Jenn\n",

For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"\"home\"\" menu. It's the \"\"recent\"\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"\"On Deck\"\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"\"on deck\"\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.\",Great price on an awesome little tablet,Jenn\n",

            "4,\"Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing.\",Great product at a great price,ProtoApocalypse\n",

            "4,\"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there.\",\"Great product, USB connection could be better\",louis5048\n",

            "4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets.

I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)\",Great tablet for kids!,TJMilw\n",

            "5,\"This is a great tablet for younger users (i'd say up to 10 years old). Performance is not on par with higher end tablets, but it is fine for younger children. The best thing about this tablet is that it comes with a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty. This even covers cracked screens. My kids 3, 5, and 8 use these tablets on long trips. They are able to play all of their favorite games. The Amazon play store underground is excellent. It has many of their favorite games, but in app purchases are included for those games.Pros: 2 year no questions replacement policy. performance for younger children, amazon underground.Cons: display is not HD, battery life is not the best.Note there is a newer model of this device that was just released. It adds a higher resolution display and better battery life. However the new model costs 129.99 when not on sale.Overall I would recommend this tablet for children 10 and younger. It would be fine for an adult, but you can save yourself some money by buying the non kids edition of the tablet for less money.\",Great tablet for younger children,nolefan\n",

            "4,\"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of.

Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough.\",Great.,Lucy\n",

            "5,\"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day.

            "5,\"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it.

            "5,\"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7\"\" and this 8\"\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.\",Hard to beat value,CasualFan\n",

            "5,\"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective.\",It fits my need perfectly,fanofBB\n",

Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.\",It's pretty average for what you are paying,theDing\n",

            "3,\"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.\",Just ok for the price,brentf\n",

            "4,\"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items.\",Mom's Firestick,theBest\n",

            "4,\"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility.\",Much better,bionicbrandon\n",
            "5,\"Last got Fire 7\"\" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7\"\" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books.\",\"Much better than Fire 7\"\", for slightly more money\",emiliosic\n",
            "4,I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.,Much quicker than previous model,Matthew\n",
